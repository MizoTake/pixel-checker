## Introduction

透明ピクセル塗りつぶしツールは、ユーザーがアップロードした画像の透明な部分を検知し、指定した色で塗りつぶすことができるWebアプリケーションです。このツールにより、透明背景の画像を任意の背景色に変更したり、透明部分を可視化したりすることが可能になります。

5. WHEN original image has no transparent pixels THEN system SHALL display appropriate message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download the processed image, so that I can use the filled image in other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image processing is complete THEN system SHALL enable download button
2. WHEN user clicks download button THEN system SHALL generate processed image file
3. WHEN download is initiated THEN system SHALL preserve original image format when possible
4. IF original format doesn't support the changes THEN system SHALL convert to PNG format
5. WHEN download completes THEN system SHALL maintain original image resolution and quality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between uploaded images, so that I can work on different images without re-uploading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple images are uploaded THEN system SHALL display a thumbnail list or dropdown for image selection
2. WHEN user clicks on a thumbnail or selects from dropdown THEN system SHALL switch to the selected image
3. WHEN image is switched THEN system SHALL maintain the current fill color setting

5. WHEN switching images THEN system SHALL preserve individual processing state for each image
6. WHEN user switches images THEN system SHALL update download button to reflect current image

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset or clear my work, so that I can start over with a new image or different settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria
